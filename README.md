# TruxTrace

- **TruxTrace** is a powerful Linux user simulation tool designed to emulate realistic command-line behavior for single and multiple users. It enables analysts, developers, and educators to simulate Linux user activity, generate forensic artifacts, and test scenarios in a safe, controlled environment.

## üêß Why the Name?

- **Tux**: The Linux mascot, representing the open-source spirit and system TruxTrace is built for.
- **Trace**: Emphasizes the tool‚Äôs goal, simulating and tracing user behavior for deeper insight, testing, or forensic purposes.

## üîç What is TruxTrace?

TruxTrace simulates user interactions with a Linux system executing commands, navigating the filesystem, scheduling cron jobs, and more. It's especially useful for:

- **Digital Forensics**: Generate realistic artifacts (e.g., `.bash_history`, syslogs) to test forensic tools.
- **Security Training**: Demonstrate attacker or admin behavior in a sandboxed environment.
- **DevOps & QA**: Simulate user activity to test monitoring and logging pipelines.
- **Education**: Teach Linux CLI behavior without needing real users.

## üöÄ Features

- Simulates single and multi-user Linux activity
- Supports command execution, file system interactions, and cron jobs
- Creates realistic artifacts (e.g., `.bash_history`, `/var/log` entries)
- User profiles: Admin, Developer, Sysadmin, General
- Docker and manual installation support
- Useful in digital forensics and education

User fake1_user not found - creating...
Created user fake1_user with home directory /home/fake1_user

[*] Note: Some operations require sudo privileges. You may be prompted for your password.

[*] Starting simulation...

[*] Simulating 100 commands for developer user fake1_user...
[*] Customizations added to /home/fake1_user/.bashrc
[*] Simulation complete. Artifacts generated:

## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª User Profiles
- Each user profile simulates distinct behavior patterns and command usage:

| Profile   | Description                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin**     | Root-level operations, system config, user management   |
| **Developer** | Git, editors (vim, nano), build tools, code compilation |
| **Sysadmin**  | Service control, package installs, log inspection       |
| **General**   | Basic file navigation, utilities, browsing activity     |

## üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Digital Forensics Use Case
- TruxTrace is widely used in digital forensics training and research. It creates simulated but realistic traces of user activity, which can be analyzed using forensic tools to test:
  - Timeline analysis
  - File and log correlation
  - Intrusion detection simulations
